## Usage

### On Instagram Reels Pages
The script will automatically activate when you visit Instagram reels pages (`https://www.instagram.com/reels/*` and `https://www.instagram.com/reel/*`).

### Controls
- **Keyboard shortcut**: Press `Shift + S` to toggle the auto-scroll feature on/off
- **Context menu**: Right-click on any page and select "Toggle Auto Scroll" or "Settings" from the userscript menu
- **Visual indicator**: Look for the green (ON) or red (OFF) indicator in the top-right corner

## Settings

This simplified version uses default settings and does not include a settings panel. The functionality is controlled only by the toggle ON/OFF.

## Compatibility

This userscript is compatible with:
- **Tampermonkey** (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Opera)
- **Greasemonkey** (Firefox)
- **Violentmonkey** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers)

## Technical Details

### Permissions Required
- `GM_getValue` / `GM_setValue`: For persistent settings storage
- `GM_addValueChangeListener`: To sync settings across tabs
- `GM_registerMenuCommand`: To add context menu options

### How It Works
1. The script monitors the Instagram page for visible video elements
2. When a video ends, it detects the event and scrolls to the next/previous reel based on settings
3. The script respects your settings for comments and number of plays
4. All settings are stored persistently using GM functions

### Script Architecture
- **DOM Detection**: Uses Intersection Observer patterns to detect visible videos
- **Event Handling**: Listens for video "ended" events to trigger scrolling
- **State Management**: Manages settings and state using GM storage
- **UI Components**: Visual indicator and settings panel injected into the page

## Troubleshooting

### Script Not Working
- Ensure you're on an Instagram reels page (`/reels/` or `/reel/` URLs)
- Check that your userscript manager is enabled
- Verify the script is enabled in your userscript manager dashboard

### Settings Not Saving
- Make sure GM functions are properly enabled in your userscript manager
- Check browser console for any error messages (Ctrl+Shift+J in most browsers)

### Visual Indicator Issues
- The indicator is positioned in the top-right corner - it may be hidden if other elements overlap
- Try refreshing the page if the indicator doesn't update properly
